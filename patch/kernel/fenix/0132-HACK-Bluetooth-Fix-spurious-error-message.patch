Subject: [PATCH 132/182] HACK: Bluetooth: Fix spurious error message

This message was debug message before 2064ee332e4c1b7495cf68b. Looks
like it was changed by accident in that patch. This is causing some
error messages when doing BR/EDR discovery since Inquiry Command
generates Command Status event, not Command Complete.

I'm sending this as RFC for now since while things seem to work fine
despite this condition (and it was like that for quite some time) it
feels like this is indeed case that should be handled by HCI request
code.
