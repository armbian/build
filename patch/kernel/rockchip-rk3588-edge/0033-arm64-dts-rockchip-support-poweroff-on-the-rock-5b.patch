Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: support poweroff on the rock-5b

Allow the rock-5b to poweroff its pmic. When issuing a "shutdown -h now"
on the rock-5b it reboots instead. Defining 'system-power-controller'
allows the rk806 to power down.

Commit c699fbfdfd54 ("arm64: dts: rockchip: Support poweroff on
NanoPC-T6") similarly resolves this issue for the nanopc-t6.
