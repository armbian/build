Subject: [PATCH] clk: meson-gxbb: set fclk_div3 as CLK_IS_CRITICAL

On the Khadas VIM2 (GXM) and LePotato (GXL) board there are problems
with reboot; e.g. a ~60 second delay between issuing reboot and the
board power cycling (and in some OS configurations reboot will fail
and require manual power cycling).

Similar to 'commit c987ac6f1f088663b6dad39281071aeb31d450a8 ("clk:
meson-gxbb: set fclk_div2 as CLK_IS_CRITICAL")' the SCPI Cortex-M4
Co-Processor seems to depend on FCLK_DIV3 being operational.

Bisect gives 'commit 05f814402d6174369b3b29832cbb5eb5ed287059 ("clk:
meson: add fdiv clock gates") between 4.16 and 4.16-rc1 as the first
bad commit. This added support for the missing clock gates before the
fixed PLL fixed dividers (FCLK_DIVx) and the clock framework which
disabled all the unused fixed dividers, thus it disabled a critical
clock path for the SCPI Co-Processor.

This change simply sets the FCLK_DIV3 gate as critical to ensure
nothing can disable it.
