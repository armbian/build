Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: meson-gxbb-odroidc2: fix GPIO lines names

The gpio line names were set in the pinctrl node instead of the gpio node,
at the time it was merged, it worked, but was obviously wrong.
This patch moves the properties to the gpio nodes.

Fixes: b03c7d6438bb ("ARM64: dts: meson-gxbb-odroidc2: Add GPIO lines names")
