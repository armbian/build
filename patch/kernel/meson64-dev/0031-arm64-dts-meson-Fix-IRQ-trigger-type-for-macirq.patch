Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: meson: Fix IRQ trigger type for macirq

A long running stress test on a custom board shipping an AXG SoCs and a
Realtek RTL8211F PHY revealed that after a few hours the connection
speed would drop drastically, from ~1000Mbps to ~3Mbps. At the same time
the 'macirq' (eth0) IRQ would stop being triggered at all and as
consequence the GMAC IRQs never ACKed.

After a painful investigation the problem seemed to be due to a wrong
defined IRQ type for the GMAC IRQ that should be LEVEL_HIGH instead of
EDGE_RISING.
