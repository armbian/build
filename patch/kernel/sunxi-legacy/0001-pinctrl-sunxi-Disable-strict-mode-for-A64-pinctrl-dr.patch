Subject: [PATCH] pinctrl: sunxi: Disable strict mode for A64 pinctrl driver

With kernel 4.15.y (and later):
*  Strict mode was enabled by default via commit 1396007286b1e2fd5dd10ae6a5ccaaaed51ab762 which can/will cause breakage with existing implementations.
* The ability to configure strict mode was added via commit aae842a3ff3385f27f1df8a9ee1494a416ec032d to allow older drivers to maintain existing behavior and avoid breakage.
* Commit cd70387f892205bcd7b8093b0837269b0739cbe0 had then explicitly disabled strict mode for most other existing SoCs but did not include A64.

This change is to update the A64 pinctrl driver similar to the other pre-existing SoC pinctrl drivers.
