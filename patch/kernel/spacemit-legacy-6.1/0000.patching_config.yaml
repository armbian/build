  # PATCH NUMBERING INFO
  #
  # Patches should be ordered in such a way that general kernel patches are applied first, then SoC-related patches and at last board-specific patches
  #
  # Patch numbers in this folder are sorted by category:
  #
  # 000* for general patches
  # 0**  for Bianbu-Linux-related patches
  # 1**  for other SoC-related patches
  # 5**  for board specific patches

  # Just some info stuff; not used by the patching scripts
