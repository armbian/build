Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Integrate the Mali GPU address to the rk3288 and
 rk3288-miqi DTS

This adds the Mali GPU address in the Rockchip 3288 device tree
definition, and adds a reference to this definition in the miqi DTS
file.

The MiQi modifications were tested with the Mali Kernel-Space driver,
version r14p0.

You'll still need to include Mali driver support to the kernel, though.
