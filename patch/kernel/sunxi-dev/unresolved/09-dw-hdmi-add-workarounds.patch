Subject: [PATCH] drm: bridge: Enable workaround in dw_hdmi for v1.32a

Allwinner SoCs have dw hdmi controller v1.32a which exhibits same
magenta line issue as i.MX6Q and i.MX6DL. Enable workaround for it.

Allwinner never released any kind of dw hdmi or errata documentation,
so it is not clear how many iterations need to be executed. One
iteration seems to be enough.
