Subject: [PATCH 2/5] ARM: dts: sun8i: Add Orange Pi PC support

The Orange Pi PC is an SBC based on the Allwinner H3 SoC with a uSD slot,
3 USB ports directly from the SoC, a 10/100M ethernet port using the
SoC's integrated PHY, USB OTG, HDMI, a TRRS headphone jack for stereo out
and composite out, a microphone, an IR receiver, a CSI connector, 2 LEDs,
a 3 pin UART header, and a 40-pin GPIO header.
