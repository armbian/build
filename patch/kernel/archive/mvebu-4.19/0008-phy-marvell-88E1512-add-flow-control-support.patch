Subject: [PATCH 08/30] phy: marvell: 88E1512: add flow control support
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Disposition: inline
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"

The Marvell PHYs support pause frame advertisments, so we should not be
masking their support off.  Add the necessary flag to the Marvell PHY
to allow any MAC level pause frame support to be advertised.
