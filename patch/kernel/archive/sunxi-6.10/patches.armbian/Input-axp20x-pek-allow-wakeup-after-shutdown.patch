Subject: Input: axp20x-pek - allow wakeup after shutdown

While the AXP20x PMIC handles the power button itself after shutting
down, it is not always possible to use the PMIC's built-in shutdown
feature, such as when other wakeup sources are needed (for example, an
IR remote or wake-on-LAN) that require firmware support. In that case,
the PMIC remains on, but suspended, until the board is powered back on.

During this "fake" off state, IRQ configuration is similar to system
sleep, where enable_irq_wake() must be call on an IRQ for it to be
wakeup capable. Run the suspend callback to arm the power button IRQs
during the shutdown process, so the power button works in this state.
