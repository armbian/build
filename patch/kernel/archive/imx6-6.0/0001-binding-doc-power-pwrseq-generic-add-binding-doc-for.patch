+The generic power sequence library
+
+Some hard-wired devices (eg USB/MMC) need to do power sequence before
+the device can be enumerated on the bus, the typical power sequence
+like: enable USB PHY clock, toggle reset pin, etc. But current
+Linux device driver lacks of such code to do it, it may cause some
+hard-wired devices works abnormal or can't be recognized by
+controller at all. The power sequence will be done before this device
+can be found at the bus.
+
+The power sequence properties is under the device node.
+
+Optional properties:
+- clocks: the input clocks for device.
+- reset-gpios: Should specify the GPIO for reset.
+- reset-duration-us: the duration in microsecond for assert reset signal.
+
+Below is the example of USB power sequence properties on USB device
+nodes which have two level USB hubs.
+
+&usbotg1 {
+	vbus-supply = <&reg_usb_otg1_vbus>;
+	pinctrl-names = "default";
+	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_usb_otg1_id>;
+	status = "okay";
+
+	#address-cells = <1>;
+	#size-cells = <0>;
+	genesys: hub@1 {
+		compatible = "usb5e3,608";
+		reg = <1>;
+
+		clocks = <&clks IMX6SX_CLK_CKO>;
+		reset-gpios = <&gpio4 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>; /* hub reset pin */
+		reset-duration-us = <10>;
+
+		#address-cells = <1>;
+		#size-cells = <0>;
+		asix: ethernet@1 {
+			compatible = "usbb95,1708";
+			reg = <1>;
+
+			clocks = <&clks IMX6SX_CLK_IPG>;
+			reset-gpios = <&gpio4 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>; /* ethernet_rst */
+			reset-duration-us = <15>;
+		};
+	};
