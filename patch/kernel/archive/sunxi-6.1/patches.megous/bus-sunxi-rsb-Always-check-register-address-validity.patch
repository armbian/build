Subject: [PATCH 153/389] bus: sunxi-rsb: Always check register address
 validity

The register address was already validated for read operations before
being truncated to a u8. Write operations have the same set of possible
addresses, and the address is being truncated from u32 to u8 here as
well, so the same check is needed.
