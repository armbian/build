Subject: [PATCH 381/389] ASoC: rockchip: Fix doubling of playback speed after
 system sleep

There is some issue with CRU on RK3399 that can be reproduced by:

- playing some audio and stopping the playback (so that runtime PM suspends I2S)
- putting system to deep sleep and resuming it (using mainline TF-A)
- playing some audio (audio plays at 2x the normal speed)

If the audio is kept playing during system sleep cycle, the issue
does not manifest. Relevant registers in CRU are identical in bug/
no-bug scenarios, so this patch is just touching the CRU registers
without actually changing anything in the end. Touching the registers
fixes the playback speed, though.
