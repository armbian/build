Subject: [PATCH 2/2] arm: dts: veyron: Added a flag to disable cache flush
 during reset

Flushing the MMC cache of ASUS Chromebooks during initialization or
"recovery" generates 10 minutes hangup, according to @SolidHal.

This is an adaptation of @SolidHal, in order to pinpoint the fix to
Veyron Chromebooks, and avoiding issues other RK3288 boards.
