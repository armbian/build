Subject: usb: core: improve handling of hubs with no ports

I get the "hub doesn't have any ports" error message on a system with
Amlogic S905W SoC. Seems the SoC has internal USB 3.0 supports but
is crippled with regard to USB 3.0 ports.
Maybe we shouldn't consider this scenario an error. So let's change
the message to info level, but otherwise keep the handling of the
scenario as it is today. With the patch it looks like this on my
system.

dwc2 c9100000.usb: supply vusb_d not found, using dummy regulator
dwc2 c9100000.usb: supply vusb_a not found, using dummy regulator
