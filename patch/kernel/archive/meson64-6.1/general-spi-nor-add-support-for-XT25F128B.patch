Subject: spi-nor: add support for XT25F128B

This adds support for the XT25F128B as found on the RockPi4b SBC.

Signed-off-by: Andreas Rammhold <andreas@rammhold.de>

This continues the efforts done in [1] & [2] that went stale. I've
tested this patch on my RockPi4b which only has the xt25f128b (and not
the xt25f32b as also propsed in [2]). I have tried to obtain a copy of
the datasheets but was unable to find them. Not sure whre you would get
them.

While [1] was already for the new spi-nor layout it was missing the bits
in the core.{c,h} files.
