Subject: [PATCH 1/2] arm64: dts: rockchip: assign rate to clk_rtc_32k on
 rk356x
Date: Tue, 10 Jan 2023 22:55:50 +0000 (UTC)

clk_rtc_32k and its child clock clk_hdmi_cec detauls to a rate of 24 MHz
and not to 32 kHz on RK356x.

Fix this by assigning clk_rtc_32k a rate of 32768, also assign the parent
to clk_rtc32k_frac.

Subject: [PATCH 2/2] arm64: dts: rockchip: fix hdmi cec on rock-3a
Date: Tue, 10 Jan 2023 22:55:58 +0000 (UTC)

HDMI CEC is configured to select HDMITX_CEC_M0 function of GPIO0_C7 by
default in rk356x.dtsi. On Radxa ROCK 3 Model A it is routed to
HDMITX_CEC_M1 according to board schematic [1].

Fix HDMI CEC by overriding pinctrl in hdmi node to select HDMITX_CEC_M1.
