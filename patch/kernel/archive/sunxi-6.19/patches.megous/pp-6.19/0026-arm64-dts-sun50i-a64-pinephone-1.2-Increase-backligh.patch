Subject: [PATCH 26/26] arm64: dts: sun50i-a64-pinephone-1.2: Increase
 backlight lth-brightness to 12

DanctNIX has been carrying a patch to raise this using udev because
10 apparently still turns the screen completely off for some phones.
A user in the postmarketOS tracker also reported this on their 1.2b model.
10 does seem to be enough for my phone, but let's raise it to 12.
