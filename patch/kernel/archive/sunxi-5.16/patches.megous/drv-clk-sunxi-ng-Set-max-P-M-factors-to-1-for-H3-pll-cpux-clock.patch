Subject: [PATCH 008/446] drv:clk:sunxi-ng: Set max P-M factors to 1 for H3
 pll-cpux clock

When using M factor greater than 1 system is experiencing
occasional lockups. P factor should only be used for clock
speeds below 288MHz. We don't use such speeds in the mainline
kernel.

This change was verified to fix lockups with PLL stress
tester available at https://xff.cz/git/arisc-firmware/.

Note that M factor must not be used outside the kernel either,
so for example u-boot needs a similar patch.
