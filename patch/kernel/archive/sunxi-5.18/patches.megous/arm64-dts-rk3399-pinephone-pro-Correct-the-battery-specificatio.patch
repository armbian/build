Subject: [PATCH 295/515] arm64: dts: rk3399-pinephone-pro: Correct the battery
 specification
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

XLS with ZCV measurements from the manufacturer say that at 25°C,
ZCV is ~200 mOhm. At 50°C it's at ~100 mOhm. Set some value in between.

Lower the charging current to something less aggressive.

Fix the current sensing resitor value (it's 10 mOhm in the schematic).
