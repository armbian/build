Subject: media: ov5640: use pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume for system suspend

If system was suspended while camera sensor was used, data and
interrupts were still coming from sensor and that caused unstable
system. Sometimes system hanged during a resume. Use
pm_runtime_force_* helpers in order to support system suspend.
