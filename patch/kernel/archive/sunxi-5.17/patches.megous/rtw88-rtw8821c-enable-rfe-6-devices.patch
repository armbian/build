Subject: [PATCH 433/456] rtw88: rtw8821c: enable rfe 6 devices

Ping-Ke Shih answered[1] a question for a user about an rtl8821ce device that
reported RFE 6, which the driver did not support. Ping-Ke suggested a possible
fix, but the user never reported back.

A second user discovered the above thread and tested the proposed fix.
Accordingly, I am pushing this change, even though I am not the author.
