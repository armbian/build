Subject: [PATCH 102/456] arm64: dts: sun50i-a64-pinephone: Add support for
 Bluetooth audio

The PinePhone has a Bluetooth chip with its PCM interface connected to
AIF3. Add the DAI link so headeset audio can be routed in hardware.

Even though the link is mono, configuring the link for 2 slots is
required for compatibility with AIF2, which uses a single 32-bit slot,
and which shares its clock dividers with AIF3. Using equal clock
frequencies allows the modem and headset to be used at the same time.
