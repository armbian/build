Subject: [PATCH 065/101] arm64:dts: sun50i-a64-pinebook enable Bluetooth

Pinebook has an RTL8723CS WiFi + BT chip, BT is connected to UART1
and uses PL4 as BT reset, PL5 as device wake GPIO, PL6 as host wake GPIO
the I2C controlling signals are connected to R_I2C bus.

Enable it in the device tree.
