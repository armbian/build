Subject: spi-nor: add support for XT25F128B & XT25Q64

This adds support for the XT25F128B as found on the RockPi4b SBC.
- Ricardo Pardini <ricardo@pardini.net> 23/jan/2023: add XT25Q64 SPI NOR chip
  - found on HK's vendor tree: https://github.com/hardkernel/linux/blame/05e3dc1688758bd401e0f7cdd9809a3f9251f7c1/drivers/mtd/spi-nor/spi-nor.c#L1024-L1026
- Ricardo pardini <ricardo@pardini.net> 14/jan/2024: convert to new SNOR_ID format
  - I just followed the lead Paolo used in rockchip64's 6.7

This continues the efforts done in [1] & [2] that went stale. I've
tested this patch on my RockPi4b which only has the xt25f128b (and not
the xt25f32b as also propsed in [2]). I have tried to obtain a copy of
the datasheets but was unable to find them. Not sure whre you would get
them.

While [1] was already for the new spi-nor layout it was missing the bits
in the core.{c,h} files.
