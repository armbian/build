Subject: [PATCH 436/440] ASoC: codec: rt5640: Resolve failure to set DMIC
 clock after playback

rt5640_set_dai_sysclk is called with freq == 0 when playback stops. This
causes DMIC setup code to fail. I2S interface doesn't need to be active
for codec to work, so don't clear rt5640->sysclk after rt5640_set_dai_sysclk
is called with freq == 0.
