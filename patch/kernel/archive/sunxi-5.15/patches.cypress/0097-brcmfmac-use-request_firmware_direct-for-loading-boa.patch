Subject: [PATCH 097/179] brcmfmac: use request_firmware_direct for loading
 board-specific nvram

Loading a board-specific nvram file is optional. If the file is not
present, we will get a warning "Direct firmware load for ... failed with
error ...", have 60 seconds delay when
CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK is enabled, and fall back to a
common one. However, users may treat this as a type of side effect and
the file is required.

Since it is optional, use request_firmware_direct() and leave an info
message in place to avoid the delay and confusion.
