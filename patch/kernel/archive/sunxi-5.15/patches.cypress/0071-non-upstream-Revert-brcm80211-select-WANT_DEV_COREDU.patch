Subject: [PATCH 071/179] non-upstream: Revert "brcm80211: select
 WANT_DEV_COREDUMP conditionally for brcmfmac"

This reverts commit 885a93cf31106808cd3ded7c5e01e35fa495fdc5.

To fix DEV_COREDUMP function to be disabled in compat/Kconfig
of backports. The root cause is because the parsing rule of
lib/kconfig.py in backports will not consider the "select <sym>
if xxx" as a sel_line. In order to aviod affecting other driver's
configs, so we do not modify the sel_line logic in backports.
