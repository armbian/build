Subject: [PATCH 153/179] brcmfmac: remove workaround cause the FW can support
 6G channels

Earlier firmware not ready support 6G channels. We add this workaround
to avoid FW crash, when driver want to remove disabled 6G channels. Now,
remove this workaround cause firmware is ready for the 6G channels.
