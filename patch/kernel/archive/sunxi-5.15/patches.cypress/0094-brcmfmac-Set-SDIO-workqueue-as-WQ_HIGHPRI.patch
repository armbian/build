Subject: [PATCH 094/179] brcmfmac: Set SDIO workqueue as WQ_HIGHPRI

commit 41b637bac0b0a90424793aa1ec265b24c4c50fb1 upstream.

This puts tasks submitted to the SDIO workqueue at the head of the queue
and runs them immediately. This gets higher RX throughput with the SDIO
bus.

This was originally submitted as [1]. The original author Wright Feng
reports

> throughput result with 43455(11ac) on 1 core 1.6 Ghz platform is
>     Without WQ_HIGGPRI TX/RX: 293/301 (mbps)
>     With    WQ_HIGHPRI TX/RX: 293/321 (mbps)

I tested this with a 43364(11bgn) on a 1 core 800 MHz platform and got
    Without WQ_HIGHPRI TX/RX: 16/19 (Mbits/sec)
    With    WQ_HIGHPRI TX/RX: 24/20 (MBits/sec)
