Subject: [PATCH 066/478] ARM: dts: rockchip: rename opp-table node names

After the conversion to YAML of the Operating Performance Points(OPP)
binding the operating-points-v2 property expects the nodename to have
the '^opp-table(-[a-z0-9]+)?$' format, so rename all Rockchip ARM dts
opp-table node names.

make ARCH=arm dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/opp-v2.yaml
