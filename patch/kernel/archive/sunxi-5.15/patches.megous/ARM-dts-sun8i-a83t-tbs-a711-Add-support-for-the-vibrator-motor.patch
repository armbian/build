Subject: [PATCH 118/478] ARM: dts: sun8i-a83t-tbs-a711: Add support for the
 vibrator motor

The board has a vibrator mottor. Hook it to the input subsystem.

According to the PMIC specification, LDO needs to be enabled (value 0b11)
to achieve the specified max driving current of 150mA. We can't drive
the motor with just GPIO mode.

In GPIO mode the chip is probably just using the regular CMOS logic
output circuitry (typically limited to around 20-35mA, but not specified
in this datasheet).
