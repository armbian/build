Subject: [PATCH 058/467] clk: rockchip: rk3399: make CPU clocks critical

The CPU clocks don't currently have any owner (e.g., cpufreq-dt doesn't
enable() them -- and even if it did, it's not early enough compared to
other consumers -- nor does arch/arm64/kernel/smp.c), and instead are
simply assumed to be "on" all the time.

They are also parents of a few other clocks which haven't been
previously exposed for other devices to consume. If we want to expose
those clocks, then the common clock framework may eventually choose to
disable their parents (including the CPU PLLs) -- which is no fun for
anyone.

Thus, mark the CPU clocks as critical, to prevent them from being
disabled implicitly.
