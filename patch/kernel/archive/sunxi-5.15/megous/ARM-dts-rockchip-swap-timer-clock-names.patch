Subject: [PATCH 067/467] ARM: dts: rockchip: swap timer clock-names

With the conversion of rockchip,rk-timer.yaml the clock-names order
was set to "pclk", "timer", but nothing was fixed in the ARM dts section
of the mainline kernel, so the swap timer clock-names that don't fit.

make ARCH=arm dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/timer/rockchip,rk-timer.yaml
