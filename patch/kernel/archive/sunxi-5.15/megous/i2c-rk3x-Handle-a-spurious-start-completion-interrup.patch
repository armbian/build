Subject: [PATCH 285/467] i2c: rk3x: Handle a spurious start completion
 interrupt flag

In a typical read transfer, start completion flag is being set after
read finishes (notice ipd bit 4 being set):

trasnfer poll=0
i2c start
rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: IRQ: state 1, ipd: 10
i2c read
rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: IRQ: state 2, ipd: 1b
i2c stop
rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: IRQ: state 4, ipd: 33

This causes I2C transfer being aborted in polled mode from a stop completion
handler:

trasnfer poll=1
i2c start
rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: IRQ: state 1, ipd: 10
i2c read
rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: IRQ: state 2, ipd: 0
rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: IRQ: state 2, ipd: 1b
i2c stop
rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: IRQ: state 4, ipd: 13
i2c stop
rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: unexpected irq in STOP: 0x10

Clearing the START flag after read fixes the issue without any obvious
side effects.

This issue was dicovered on RK3566 when adding support for powering
off the RK817 PMIC.
