Subject: [PATCH 409/467] PM / devfreq: Drop code for descending freq_table

Since commit 416b46a2627a ("PM / devfreq: Show the all available
frequencies"), freq_table's documentation requires it to be sorted in
ascending order. That commit modified available_frequencies_show() to
assume that order. This is also the order used by all existing drivers
and by set_freq_table().

However, there is still some code left over for compatibility with a
freq_table sorted descending. To avoid confusion, let's remove it.
