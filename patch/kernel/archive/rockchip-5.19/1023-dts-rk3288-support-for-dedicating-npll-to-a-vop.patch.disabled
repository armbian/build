Subject: [PATCH 4/6] dts: rk3288: support for dedicating npll to a vop

This patch is taken from Urja Rannikko ( @urjaman ) patchset here :
https://github.com/urjaman/arch-c201/blob/master/linux-c201/0020-RK3288-HDMI-clock-hacks-combined.patch
https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg673156.html

The original description was :

    Add the VOP DCLKs to the assigned clocks list so their
    parents can be set in the dts include files for
    devices that do dedicate npll to a vop.
