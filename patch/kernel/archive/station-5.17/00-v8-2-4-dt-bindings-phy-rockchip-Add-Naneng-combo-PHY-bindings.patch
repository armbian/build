+  rockchip,enable-ssc:

+    description:
+      The option SSC can be enabled for U3, SATA and PCIE.
+      Most commercially available platforms use SSC to reduce EMI.
+
+  rockchip,ext-refclk:
+    type: boolean
+    description:
+      Many PCIe connections, especially backplane connections,
+      require a synchronous reference clock between the two link partners.
+      To achieve this a common clock source, referred to as REFCLK in
+      the PCI Express Card Electromechanical Specification,
+      should be used by both ends of the PCIe link.
+      In PCIe mode one can choose to use an internal or an external reference
+      clock.
+      By default the internal clock is selected. The PCIe PHY provides a 100MHz
+      differential clock output(optional with SSC) for system applications.
+      When selecting this option an externally 100MHz differential
+      reference clock needs to be provided to the PCIe PHY.
