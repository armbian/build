From: Chen-Yu Tsai <wens@csie.org>

There is a PPU0 reset control bit in the same register as the PPU1
reset control. This missing reset control is for the PCK-600 unit
in the SoC. Manual tests show that the reset control indeed exists,
and if not configured, the system will hang when the PCK-600 registers
are accessed.

Add a reset entry for it at the end of the existing ones.
