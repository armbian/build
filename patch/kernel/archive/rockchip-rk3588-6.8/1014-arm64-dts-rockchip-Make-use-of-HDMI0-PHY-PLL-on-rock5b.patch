Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Make use of HDMI0 PHY PLL on rock-5b

The initial vop2 support for rk3588 in mainline is not able to handle
all display modes supported by connected displays, e.g.
2560x1440-75.00Hz, 2048x1152-60.00Hz, 1024x768-60.00Hz.

Additionally, it doesn't cope with non-integer refresh rates like 59.94,
29.97, 23.98, etc.

Make use of the HDMI0 PHY PLL to support the additional display modes.

Note this requires commit "drm/rockchip: vop2: Improve display modes
handling on rk3588", which needs a rework to be upstreamable.
