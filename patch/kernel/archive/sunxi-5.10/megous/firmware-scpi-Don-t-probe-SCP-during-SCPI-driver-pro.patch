Subject: [PATCH 034/323] firmware: scpi: Don't probe SCP during SCPI driver
 probe

We want to have this driver builtin and be able to load SCP after it
probes at the same time. This allows that.

In the future, we'll load SCP firmware from u-boot, but for now
we want to be able to experiment more freely, by loading SCP after
boot.
