Subject: [PATCH 317/351] ASoC: dt-bindings: sun50i-codec: Add binding for
 internal bias

In order to properly bias headset microphones, there should be a
resistor between pins HBIAS and MICDET. This can be an external
resistor, but the codec also provides an internal 2.2K resistor which
can be enabled by a register.

This patch adds a device-tree property to the sun50i-codec-analog driver
to take advantage of this feature.
