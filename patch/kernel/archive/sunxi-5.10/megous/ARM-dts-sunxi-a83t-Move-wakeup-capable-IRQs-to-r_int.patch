Subject: [PATCH 158/323] ARM: dts: sunxi: a83t: Move wakeup-capable IRQs to
 r_intc

All IRQs that can be used to wake up the system must be routed through
r_intc, so they are visible to firmware while the system is suspended.

For the A83T, r_intc IRQ numbers are offset by 32 from the GIC IRQ
numbers.
