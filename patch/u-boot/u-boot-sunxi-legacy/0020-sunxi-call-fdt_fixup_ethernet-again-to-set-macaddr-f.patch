Subject: [PATCH 20/20] sunxi: call fdt_fixup_ethernet again to set macaddr for
 more aliases

Sometimes some ethernet aliases do not exist in U-Boot FDT but they
exist in the FDT used to boot the system. In this situation
setup_environment is called again in ft_board_setup to generate macaddr
environment variable for them. However now the call to
fdt_fixup_ethernet is moved before the call of ft_board_setup.

Call fdt_fixup_ethernet again to add MAC addresses for the extra
ethernet aliases.
