Subject: [ARCHEOLOGY] Add rk3288 xt-q8l-v10 CSC board (#1158)

> X-Git-Archeology: > recovered message: > This merge request contains various files which add support for xt-q8l-v10 boards (TVBox) equipped with Rockchip RK3288 SoC, AP6330 WiSoC (BCM4330 WiFi + Bluetooth), 2 GB DRAM (LPDDR2 or DDR3), 8 Gb eMMC, Gigabit Ethernet, 3 USB (1 OTG), 1 microSD slot, SPDIF optical output, 1 HDMI.
> X-Git-Archeology: > recovered message: > Kernel patches:
> X-Git-Archeology: > recovered message: > This thouches all three linux-rockchip-* kernelconfigs, just adds brcmfmac and brcmutil modules and remote controller support. default flavor activates rockchip own remote controller driver, next and dev use the mainline GPIO CIR driver (dev has lirc userland support activated too).
> X-Git-Archeology: > recovered message: > About the remote controller, an additional kernel module is added to the existing keymaps which is activated via device tree.
> X-Git-Archeology: > recovered message: > About possibly clashing patches assert-phy-reset-when-waking-up-in-rk3288-platform.patch should be checked against other rk3288 boards because it addresses an errata in rk3288 which causes the USB Host ports to stop responding when exiting from autosleep. On my device if I connect the first USB device when the system is already running, the USB Host gets stuck without this patch. Probably to work correctly on other platforms the device tree should include the proper reset lines of the USB PHYs (for reference, check patch/kernel/rockchip-dev/xt-q8l-v10-add-device-tree.patch starting from line 869).
> X-Git-Archeology: > recovered message: > Patch 1-2-regulator-act8865-add-restart-handler-for-act8846.patch adds a restart handler which allows reboot using SIPC bit on act8846 power regulator. Possibly MiQi board is affected (is reboot working there?), others (tinkerboard) should not care.
> X-Git-Archeology: > recovered message: > Patch brcmfmac-add-ap6330-firmware.patch adds firmware file names for ap6330 , should be harmless in other cases.
> X-Git-Archeology: > recovered message: > Patch 0010-GPU-Mali-Midgard-remove-rcu_read_lock-references.patch is from Miouyouyou. It should be harmless, it was suggested by him to do some tests with devfreq
> X-Git-Archeology: > recovered message: > Other patches just add the proper device trees, Kconfig and bits for supporting the board as a regular kernel supported board and should not interfere with anything else
> X-Git-Archeology: > recovered message: > U-Boot patches:
> X-Git-Archeology: > recovered message: > All the patches for u-boot are per-board, so nothing is added which may interfere with other existing boards here. They include the device tree and u-boot config and also a couple of patches to support the silergy power regulators driving current to CPU and GPU
