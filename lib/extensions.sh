*meta-Meta time!*
Implement this hook to work with/on the meta-data made available by the extension manager.
Interesting stuff to process:
- `"${EXTENSION_MANAGER_TMP_DIR}/hook_point_calls.txt"` contains a list of all hook points called, in order.
- For each hook_point in the list, more files will have metadata about that hook point.
  - `${EXTENSION_MANAGER_TMP_DIR}/hook_point.orig.md` contains the hook documentation at the call site (inline docs), hopefully in Markdown format.
  - `${EXTENSION_MANAGER_TMP_DIR}/hook_point.compat` contains the compatibility names for the hooks.
  - `${EXTENSION_MANAGER_TMP_DIR}/hook_point.exports` contains _exported_ environment variables.
  - `${EXTENSION_MANAGER_TMP_DIR}/hook_point.vars` contains _all_ environment variables.
- `${defined_hook_point_functions}` is a map of _all_ the defined hook point functions and their extension information.
- `${hook_point_function_trace_sources}` is a map of all the hook point functions _that were really called during the build_ and their BASH_SOURCE information.
- `${hook_point_function_trace_lines}` is the same, but BASH_LINENO info.
After this hook is done, the `${EXTENSION_MANAGER_TMP_DIR}` will be removed.
