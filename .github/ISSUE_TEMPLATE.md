Please note that this is a **build script** issue tracker.
Issues with provided images should go to the Armbian forum.
Issues with the `armbian-config` application should go to its [repository](https://github.com/armbian/config).
Issues with Device Tree overlays should go to the [dedicated forum thread](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/3787-testers-wanted-sunxi-device-tree-overlays/).

Please use the Armbian forum (https://forum.armbian.com/) for:

 - reporting boot failures (please read [the documentation](https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Getting-Started/) first!),
 - asking for help with Armbian if it is **not** related to building the kernel and/or OS image (please use forum search and Google search first!),
 - reporting kernel crashes or similar issues,
 - asking for support of new boards or third party hardware (such as wireless and DVB adapters, I2C/SPI sensors, USB touch screens and HDMI displays),
 - etc.

Please use this issue tracker only for the build script related bugs and enhancements, such as:

 - requesting changes to the kernel configuration,
 - requesting changes to the default package lists,
 - discussing the kernel and/or u-boot patches,
 - discussing Armbian specific customizations made at image build time,
 - discussing changes and enhancements to the image creation process

Please note that nightly images and dev kernel branches are provided with minimal support, and only build failures with default (provided) configuration can be considered an issue that needs to be fixed.

Please remove the text above before opening an issue.
