        Please use checkboxes for subtasks and link relevant PRs or issues for reference.
        
        You can use title tags like _Task_, _Story_ or _Epic_ similar to Jira [like described in the docs](https://docs.armbian.com/Process_Managing_Workflow/).
        A _Story_ or _Epic_ may reference other _Tasks_ (GitHub issues). This task will automatically be mirrored to [Jira](https://armbian.atlassian.net/browse/AR).

        Make sure to update your progress in case anyone wants to help with a task so noone is doing duplicate work.
        Add the label "_Discussion_" to get feedback on your task and "_Help needed_" if you would prefer to not work on this this alone.
