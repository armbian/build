# How to contribute

## Getting started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Read the README.md for build instructions

## Issue

Reporting bugs is one of the best ways to contribute. However, a good bug report has some very specific qualities, so try to recreate it with a clean build framework clone. Then search for [existing and closed issues](https://github.com/armbian/build/issues). If you don't find it there, [open a new issue](https://github.com/armbian/build/issues/new).

## Adding a new feature

You are welcome to suggest or contribute directly to the code with a pull request. In case your proposed changes are large, remember to discuss them prior to development.

## Join development

Join regulars on their active missions, start maintaining any part of the code: patches, drivers or scripted applications like [armbian-config](https://github.com/armbian/config), address [community wishes](https://github.com/armbian/build/issues),
