# This configures label matching for PR's.
#
# The keys are labels, and the values are lists of minimatch patterns
# to which those labels apply.
#
# NOTE: This can only add labels, not remove them.
# NOTE: Due to YAML syntax limitations, patterns or labels which start
# with a character that is part of the standard YAML syntax must be
# quoted.
#
# Please keep the labels sorted and deduplicated.
