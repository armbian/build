# Web3 Pi Staking OS

**Web3 Pi Staking OS** is a custom Ubuntu-based image built specifically for running a full Ethereum node in a Solo Staking setup on the Raspberry Pi 5.

This project is a fork of the [Armbian Build Framework](https://github.com/armbian/build), extended with preinstalled packages, configurations, and system tweaks tailored for Web3 Pi.

The resulting image is designed to be flashed to a microSD card and booted on a Raspberry Pi 5 with an external 2TB drive attached.
