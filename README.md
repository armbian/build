## What this project does?

- builds custom Debian based Linux system optimized for [supported single board computers](https://www.armbian.com/download/),
- covers root filesystem generation, kernel image compilation and bootloader compilation,
- maintains low-level control software for a [selection of hardware](https://www.armbian.com/download/),
- provides a consistent user experience by keeping system standards across different SBC platforms.

<p align=right>&nbsp;</p>

## What do you need to get started?
    
- x64 machine with at least 2GB of memory and ~35GB of disk space for the VM, container or native OS,
- Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 / Focal 20.04 x64 for native building or any [Docker](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Building-with-Docker/) capable x64 Linux for containerised,
- superuser rights (configured sudo or root access).

## How to build an image or a kernel?

```text
apt-get -y install git
git clone https://github.com/armbian/build
cd build
./compile.sh
```

<p align=right><a href=#table-of-contents>⇧</a></p>

## Build parameter examples

Show work in progress areas in interactive mode:

```text
./compile.sh EXPERT="yes"
```

Run build tools inside Docker container:

```text
./compile.sh docker
```

Build minimal CLI Debian buster based image for Odroid XU4. Use modern kernel and write image to the SD card:

```text
./compile.sh BOARD="odroidxu4" BRANCH="current" RELEASE="buster" CARD_DEVICE="/dev/sda" \
KERNEL_ONLY="no" KERNEL_CONFIGURE="no" BUILD_DESKTOP="no" BUILD_MINIMAL="yes"
```
