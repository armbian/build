### Purpose of This Repository

The **Armbian Linux Build Framework** creates minimal, efficient, and fully [customizable operating system images](https://docs.armbian.com/#key-features) based on **Debian** or **Ubuntu**. It is designed specifically for **low-resource single board computers (SBCs)** and other embedded devices.

This toolchain compiles a custom **Linux kernel**, **bootloader**, and **root filesystem**, providing fine-grained control over:

- Kernel versions and configuration
- Bootloader selection and customization
- Filesystem layout and compression
- Additional firmware, overlays, and device trees
- System optimizations for performance and size

The framework supports **native**, **cross**, and **containerized** builds for multiple architectures (`x86_64`, `aarch64`, `armhf`, `riscv64`), and is suitable for development, testing, production deployment, or automation pipelines.

It ensures **consistency across devices** while remaining modular and extensible through a variety of configuration files, templates, and user patches.

### Quick Start
