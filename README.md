## What does this project do?

- Builds custom **kernel**, **image** or a **distribution** optimized for low-resource hardware,
- Include filesystem generation, low-level control software, kernel image and **bootloader** compilation,
- Provides a **consistent user experience** by keeping system standards across different platforms.

## Getting started

### Requirements for self hosted

- x86_64 / aarch64 machine
- at least 2GB of memory and ~35GB of disk space for VM, container or bare metal installation
- [Armbian / Ubuntu Jammy 22.04.x](https://github.com/armbian/sdk) for native building or any Docker capable Linux for containerised
- Windows 10/11 with WSL2 subsystem running Ubuntu Jammy 22.04.x
- Superuser rights (configured sudo or root access).
- Make sure your system is up-to-date! Outdated Docker binaries, for example, can cause trouble.

For stable branch use `--branch=v23.11`

```bash
apt-get -y install git
git clone --depth=1 --branch=main https://github.com/armbian/build
cd build
./compile.sh
```

<a href="#how-to-build-an-image-or-a-kernel"><img src=".github/README.gif" alt="Armbian logo" width="100%"></a>

- Interactive graphical interface.
- Prepares the workspace by installing the necessary dependencies and sources.
- It guides the entire process and creates a kernel package or a ready-to-use SD card image.

### Build parameter examples

Show work-in-progress areas in interactive mode:

```bash
./compile.sh EXPERT="yes"
```

Build minimal CLI Armbian Jammy for Bananapi M5 with LTS kernel:

```bash
./compile.sh \
BOARD=bananapim5 \
BRANCH=current \
RELEASE=jammy \
BUILD_MINIMAL=yes \
BUILD_DESKTOP=no \
KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no
```

Build with GitHub actions: ([advanced version](https://github.com/armbian/os/blob/main/.github/workflows/complete-artifact-one-by-one.yml))

```
name: "Build Armbian"
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  build-armbian:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: armbian/build@main
        with:
          armbian_token:     "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"  # GitHub token
          armbian_release:   "jammy"                        # userspace
          armbian_target:    "build"                        # build=image, kernel=kernel
          armbian_board:     "bananapim5"                   # build target
```
Generated image will be uploaded to your repository release. Note: GitHub upload file limit is 2Gb.
