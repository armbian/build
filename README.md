## What this project does?

- Builds custom Linux optimized for [single board computers(SBCs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer).
- Including filesystem generation, low-level control software, kernel image compilation and bootloader compilation.
- Provides a consistent user experience by keeping system standards across different platforms.

## Getting started

### Prepare your environment

- x64 / aarch64 machine with at least 2GB of memory and ~35GB of disk space for a VM, container or native OS,
- Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 x64 or aarch64 for native building or any [Docker](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Building-with-Docker/) capable x64 / aarch64 Linux for containerised,
- Superuser rights (configured sudo or root access).

### Simply start with the build script

```bash
apt-get -y install git
git clone https://github.com/armbian/build
cd build
./compile.sh
```

<a href="#how-to-build-an-image-or-a-kernel"><img src=".github/README.gif" alt="Armbian logo" width="100%"></a>

- Interactive graphical interface.
- The workspace will be prepared by installing the necessary dependencies and sources.
- It guides the entire process until a kernel package or ready-to-use image of the SD card is created.

### Build parameter examples

Show work in progress areas in interactive mode:

```bash
./compile.sh EXPERT="yes"
```

Run build framework inside Docker container:

```bash
./compile.sh docker
```

Build minimal CLI Armbian Focal image for Orangepi Zero. Use modern kernel and write image to the SD card:

```bash
./compile.sh \
BOARD=orangepizero \
BRANCH=current \
RELEASE=focal \
BUILD_MINIMAL=yes \
BUILD_DESKTOP=no \
KERNEL_ONLY=no \
KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no \
CARD_DEVICE="/dev/sda"
```
