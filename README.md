## What does this project do?

- Builds custom kernel, image or a distribution optimized for low-resource hardware,
- Include filesystem generation, low-level control software, kernel image and bootloader compilation,
- Provides a consistent user experience by keeping system standards across different platforms.

## Getting started

### Basic requirements

- x86_64 or aarch64 machine with at least 2GB of memory and ~35GB of disk space for a virtual machine, [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), container or bare metal installation
- Ubuntu Jammy 22.04.x amd64 or aarch64 for native building or any Docker capable amd64 / aarch64 Linux for containerised
- Superuser rights (configured sudo or root access).
- Make sure all your system components are up-to-date. Outdated Docker binaries, for example, can cause trouble.

### Start with the build script

```bash
apt-get -y install git
git clone --depth=1 --branch=main https://github.com/armbian/build
cd build
./compile.sh
```

<a href="#how-to-build-an-image-or-a-kernel"><img src=".github/README.gif" alt="Armbian logo" width="100%"></a>

- Interactive graphical interface.
- Prepares the workspace by installing the necessary dependencies and sources.
- It guides the entire process and creates a kernel package or a ready-to-use SD card image.

### Build parameter examples

Show work-in-progress areas in interactive mode:

```bash
./compile.sh EXPERT="yes"
```

Build minimal CLI Armbian Focal image for Orangepi Zero. Use modern kernel and write image to the SD card:

```bash
./compile.sh \
BOARD=orangepizero \
BRANCH=current \
RELEASE=focal \
BUILD_MINIMAL=yes \
BUILD_DESKTOP=no \
KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no \
CARD_DEVICE="/dev/sdX"
```
