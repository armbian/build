# Use LL (link-layer, sans timestamp) DUIDs for DHCP.
# It is the default for v4, but not for v6.
# Having it set to LL allows network admins to do MAC-based reservations for v6 the same way there's done for v4.
# If the MAC address of an interface is 01:02:03:04:05:06, then the DUID will be 00030001010203040506
