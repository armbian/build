# Bootloader
## Has custom default configuration of the u-boot that should be used -- https://linux-sunxi.org/Olimex_Teres-A64#Mainline_U-Boot

# Firmware
## According to h-node it's able to run firmware-less on linux-libre with a hack[https://h-node.org/wifi/view/en/1725/Realtek-Semiconductor-Co---Ltd--RTL8723BE-PCIe-Wireless-Network-Adapter]
## Firmware rtlwifi/rtl8723bs (provided in 'firmware-realtek' on debian) is needed for WiFi/BLE module[https://olimex.miraheze.org/wiki/Products/Teres-1#Non-Free]
## NOTE(Krey): Pulseaudio is needed for the audio to work especially in pipewire configuration, I wasn't able to make it work just off of ALSA
PACKAGE_LIST_BOARD="firmware-realtek pulseaudio"

# Floods the system with bunch of bloat where we only need 'firmware-realtek'
INSTALL_ARMBIAN_FIRMWARE="no"
