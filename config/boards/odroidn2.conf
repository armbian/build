# Odroid N2 requires Odroid's u-boot for stable operation for mainline kernel
# and also for legacy booting. These vars will be handled by the family (meson-g12b.conf)

# 'edge' should use mainline, allowing for stabilizing development.

# Unfortunately it uses n2_plus instead of n2-plus as the Kernel expects it.
#    So there is a hack at and around config/bootscripts/boot-meson64.cmd L90
