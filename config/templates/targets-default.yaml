#
# This DEFAULT config generates all artefacts except for EOS targets.
# It will be used if no other targets file is found in userpatches/targets.yaml (or TARGETS_FILENAME/TARGETS_FILE is passed).
# It is meant to be used for testing and development.
# It uses the latest Ubuntu LTS release, xfce desktop, without appgroups and with the config_base desktop config.
