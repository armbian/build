The u-boot binary files included in this directory are the ones originally built
by balbes150 as part of his former TV Box builds.

These should be recreated from scratch and either built automatically as part
of the Armbian build process, or at least there should be instructions provided
here as to how to rebuild them from source.

I don't like releasing binary blobs of unknown origin, but as these are what
people have been using for Amlogic TV Boxes for a couple of years this is 
the status quo until something better is completed.
