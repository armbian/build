/boot/overlay/README for RockPI-S -- 12 Jul 2022

These Device Tree Source overlay files improve the performance of your RockPI-S

Which overlays to add, if any, depends the board version you have.

All versions may benefit from applying 
  rk3308-rock-pi-s-sdio10Mhz.dts
to increase the clock rate of the SDIO to the WiFi chip from 1Mhz to 10Mhz.
You should see throughput increase from 300kBs to >2Mbs as a result.
The overlay
  rk3308-rock-pi-s-sdio4Mhz.dts
is a less agressive alternative.
If you find that 10Mhz is unstable and 4Mhz is,
please report the details on the forum.

V1.3 of the RockPi-S uses a the B-S variant of the RK3308 that is optimized
for lower core voltages than the older chips on the V1.2 and V1.1 boards.
All V1.3 boards should apply the
  rk3308bs-rock-pi-s.dts
overlay to lowers the core voltages to reduce power consumption.
This also enables operation at 1.1Ghz.

Optionally, V1.3 boards may add the
  rk3308bs-rock-pi-s-1.3Ghz.dts
to overclock the B-S CPU to 1.3Ghz.
Add the rk3308bs-rock-pi-s-1.3Ghz.dts  *after adding*  rk3308bs-rock-pi-s.dts

Install each of the applicable overlays only once
with the armbian-add-overlay command.

Example (for the V1.3 board):
#  armbian-add-overlay rk3308-rock-pi-s-sdio10Mhz.dts
#  armbian-add-overlay rk3308bs-rock-pi-s.dts
#  armbian-add-overlay rk3308bs-rock-pi-s-1.3Ghz.dts  #optional overclocking

You may uninstall device tree overlays by deleting them from the
  user_overlays=
line in the
  /boot/armbianEnv.txt
file and/or simply deleting the corresponging .dtbo files from the
  /boot/overlay-user
directory.
