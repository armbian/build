# percentage of zram used as swap compared to physically available DRAM.

# percentage of DRAM available to zram. If this amount is exceeded the zram
# devices used for swap simply behave as if the device is full. You need to
# adjust/increase this value only if you want to work with massive memory
# overcommitment (ZRAM_PERCENTAGE exceeding 150 for example)

# Which algorithm for zram based swapping. Seems lzo is best choice on ARM:

# SWAP_ALGORITHM=lzo

# Which algorithm to choose for zram based ramlog partition
# RAMLOG_ALGORITHM=zstd

# Which algorithm to choose for zram based /tmp
# TMP_ALGORITHM=zstd

# If defined a separate partition will be used as zram backing device. Be CAREFUL
# which partition you assign and read starting from CONFIG_ZRAM_WRITEBACK in
