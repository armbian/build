This theme matches the design of Unity.
It aims to bring a convenient and powerful interface for netbooks under Ubuntu.
But it can of course be used anywhere.

The heme has 2 docks, both being hidden when they overlap a window, so it fits well a small screen. Some icons like the clock and the power-manager are always visible to bring you the information at any time.
