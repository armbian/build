#b Prevent this launcher from stealing this application from taskbar?
#{If you chose to mix launcher and applications, this option will deactivate this behaviour for this launcher only. It can be useful for instance for a launcher that launches a script in a terminal, but you don't want it to steal the terminal's icon from the taskbar.}
