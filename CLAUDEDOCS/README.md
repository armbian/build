# RG34XXSP Armbian Community Build

## What is this Project?

This project aims to create a complete Armbian community build for the RG34XXSP device, transforming it into a full-featured ARM64 Linux computer. Unlike gaming-focused distributions, this follows Armbian's mission to provide standard desktop and server computing capabilities on ARM hardware.

üõ†Ô∏è **Development Branch**: All Armbian code changes are being made on the [`rg34xxsp-support`](https://github.com/armbian/build/compare/main...mitswan:build:rg34xxsp-support) branch for eventual upstream submission.

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is NOT a gaming distribution** - This project focuses on general-purpose computing following Armbian's mission.

## Development Status

**Status:** Phase 2.2 - Reproducible build process created with working hybrid system fully documented and automated.

- ‚úÖ **Phase 0**: Discovery and comprehensive hardware research
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: DTB discovery and boot validation - Working hybrid system achieved
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2.1**: Working system analysis and documentation completed
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2.2**: Reproducible build process creation
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Phase 2.3**: File replacement strategy (Armbian build integration) ‚ú®*In Progress - Debugging Boot Issues*‚ú®
- üîú **Phase 3**: Enhanced system features (network, SSH, display)
- üîú **Phase 4**: Armbian build system integration (step-by-step migration)
