AI is excellent at solving technical problems however the human guidance is critical - otherwise a full AI led approach might have resulted in A) making a build that works but cant be submitted to armbian and/or B) persisting with rigid adherence to compiling a bootloader that might have wasted a lot of time

^^ the AI is all too willing to charge ahead and solve a problem but can be susceptible to ^^^
^^ be a consultant to your AI ^^

Anecdote about regular retrospectives being important for AI. but try to time your retrospectives to before it compacts the converation and definitely before you end the session.

Anecdote around AI Led research

Anecdote around the TOKEN_OPTIMISATION strategy to tee the build since it'd use up at least 30% of my toke quota.

Co-authoring a blog lets the AI kind of know more about your intention and motivation - prior to starting on the blogpost Claude kept thinking the purpose was for gaming (and adding performance optimisation steps) when in reality I wanted to use it as a edge server with built in display.

this works with my adhd mind where i can jump between multiple claude windows and projects at once

loves to dive right in an solve problems directly but you have to monitor it to make sure it stays compliant with standards

do a compact before you start a new phase (so you can do the retrospective after)

I find myself constantly reminding it to document things - mostly for its own benefit. Unlike humans which is for others benefits.

Maybe there is an 'agile for ai' post here... in the analogy:
  - i am the product owner (maybe pm but since it is 1:1 maybe that doesnt match)
  - regular replanning

Claude is very quick to jump to assumptions. Especially during debugging where it will be wrongly confident about its reasons, causing it to run down rabbit holes. Maybe I need to think about how to counterbalance this in my agile framework,

Tendency to leave legacy things in, and constantly needing cleanup.

Planning around Claude's compact cycles - trying to get it to document things before it compacts. In one scenario we had a breakthrogh and got a bootable device but following a compact, claude forgot how to do it and it took a whole day to get back to the same place (but better documented)

You dont want to hit a a compact while you are investigating an issue - try to compact before or create a File for Claude to put its findings

Regular housekeeping - Claude tends to leave a lot of garbage around (obsolete files, functions, etc.)

Be extra cautious about confirmation bias - the AI is a little bit of a yes man
